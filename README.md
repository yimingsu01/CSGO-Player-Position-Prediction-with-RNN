# CSGO-Player-Position-Prediction-with-RNN
Predicting players position in demo (and possibly in game) with RNN and LSTM

This repo predicts the position of the players one side at a time.

Huge shoutout to [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy) for providing a way to parse CS:GO demos.  

# Todo
